I was delighted to be able to give a talk at [BibleTech] this year. I spoke for
almost exactly 40 minutes on the subject of digital typography, with a focus on
some of the nitty-gritty details that make texts readable... or not. Here is the
screen capture and audio from the talk!

You can also access the [slides] whenever you like (though note that they were
designed to be complements to the talk, *not* the content of the talk, and as
such they elide a great deal of the content).
