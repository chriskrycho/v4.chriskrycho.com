Over the past few months, I have been doing a read-the-Bible-in-90-days plan,
and decided to take the opportunity to read through the Holman Christian
Standard Bible. I have not *quite* finished the plan, but I *have* read the
whole text of the Bible in that time (just not in sequence!). The HCSB is a very
solid and reliable translation, and I have no qualms recommending it, alongside
the NLT, the NIV,[^NIV] the ESV, and the NASB as valuable and helpful modern
translations. (Other translations may also be helpful, but those are the English
translations with which I am most familiar.)

Rather than try to do a detailed analysis and review---a task that would take a
great many words indeed---I thought I would simply offer some observations on
the text gleaned from this read through.

## The Translation
Published by Holman Bible Publishers, the HCSB is a relatively recent
translation, dating to 2004. (Holman is part of Lifeway, the for-profit
publishing arm of the Southern Baptist Convention.) The HCSB was totally new
translation, rather than a revision of an older tradition, based on the
NA27/UBS4 Greek text and the BHS5 text. The translation committee called their
translation strategy "optimal equivalence", aiming for a balance between the
more wooden "functional" and the more free (but also looser) "dynamic"
equivalence philosophies. (On the name of their equivalence, more in a moment.)

### General Philosophy
The translators described their overall philosophy as "optimal
equivalence"---shooting for a balance between "formal" and "dynamic"
equivalence, perhaps most popularly represented by the NASB and NIV
respectively.

While I find the translators' goals admirable, and I think the results are
generally fairly good, a word about their name for the philosophy is in order.
To call one's translation philosophy "optimal equivalence" is nearly
tautological. *Every* translator thinks that her approach is optimal given the
goals she sets herself. Otherwise, she would pick a different strategy---one
more *optimal* for the goals of her translation!

As for the results, in truth I think the come a great deal closer to "dynamic
equivalence" than the translators might care to acknowledge. The difference
between "optimal" and "dynamic" equivalence here is fairly lean; in truth, it
seems more a matter of the particular tastes of the translation committee than
of actually being more "functionally" equivalent than the NIV. If we conceived
of the dynamic-functional equivalence scale as ranging from 1 to 10, with 1
being a full paraphrase and 10 being a 1st-year student's word-for-word gloss of
the original, the NIV would be about a 4 and the HSCB about a 5. (I would rate
the NLT about a 2.5--3, the ESV a 7, and the NASB 8--8.5.)

I have no problem with that; the result is a fairly solid reading Bible. Like
the NIV and the NLT, its biggest weakness is a certain flatness of style---there
is little to distinguish Paul from Peter or the Chronicler from the author of
Kings. The ESV manages to bring through some of those authorial quirks and
idiosyncrasies a bit more, but sometimes at the cost of clear English.[^optimal]
The biggest place this flattening shows up is in the poetic language: the Psalms
here are not *bad*, but they're never especially beautiful, either. That's a
real shame. The prosaic meaning of the Psalms does come through well enough, but
at the cost of precisely that element that makes them so compelling and have
given them such a lasting influence: their poetic voice.[^poetics]

### Leaving Behind the KJV
The HCSB, to a greater extent than many other conservative translations,
demonstrates considerable willingness to diverge from the readings of the KJV.
In many ways, this is good: it makes for better (modern) English, and in many
cases a better translation as well, since our knowledge both of the textual
basis of the Bible and of the original languages has advanced somewhat since
1611.[^KJV] Occasionally, though, and especially in the poetic sections, the
result is a serious flattening of the text. Compare, for example, their
translation of Job 38:11. The HCSB reads:
 
>     when I declared: “You may come this far, but no farther;
>         your proud waves stop here”?

The KJV has:

>     and said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further:
>         and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?

Of course, I am not *terribly* sad to see the archaic pronouns go (though I do
miss their precision a bit!). But "here shall thy proud waves be stayed" sings
in a way that "your proud waves stop here" just... doesn't. It's not bad, but it
isn't particularly poetic, either. The ESV follows the KJV more closely, with:

>     and said, ‘Thus far shall you come, and no farther,
>         and here shall your proud waves be stayed’?

That manages to keep the poetry of the KJV while using modern English, perhaps
the best tradeoff under the circumstances. Given the extent to which the
language and rhythm of the KJV have shaped modern English, there are times
abandoning the KJV actually *hurts* the translation. This goes back to the point
above: poetics matter. This is not a failing of the HCSB alone, though; every
dynamic equivalence translation I've read falls into the same trap. (And again:
the functionally equivalent translations fall into *other* traps; in any case no
one ever accused the NASB of containing particularly *beautiful* English---in
poetry or prose!)

### The Divine Name
The HCSB's handling of the divine name (יהוה) is... strange. The translators
chose to supply "Yahweh" in some places but <span class="smcp">"Lord"</span> or
<span class="smcp">"God"</span> in others. They opted to use "Yahweh" anytime
the author explicitly refers to the name (שׁמ) of God in the nearest sentences.
However, they do not continue to transliterate the name in the *follwing*
context, even when that would be appropriate. As a result, it is not uncommon
for a passage to include *both* "Yahweh" and <span class="smcp">"Lord"</span>,
which muddles things considerably. They also supply "Yahweh" from time to time
when "name" is *not* in the immediate context.

This particular approach is, in my view, unhelpful at best. Those who are
offended by seeing the divine name in print or hearing it read aloud will be
offended. Those who are *not* offended and find it helpful to see and hear the
divine name directly will only find it some of the time. Moreover, the
inconsistency within a given passage can make it even *less* clear than in a
translation that simply sticks to the small-capitals convention (<span
class="smcp">"Lord"/"God"</span>). I am generally approve transliterating the
name, but consistency is often the most important element for clarity and
comprehension.

### Miscellaneous Translation Notes
There were a number of other quirks in the translation I thought worth noting.

- Instead of the more usual "...declares the <span class="smcp">Lord</span>" or
  "...says the <span class="smcp">Lord</span>," the tranlators opted to go with
  "This is the <span class="smcp">Lord's</span> declaration..." and "This is
  what the <span class="smcp">Lord</span> says...." This is a perfectly
  defensible translation, but is another case where diverging from the
  traditional reading, even for more normal English, actually sounds a bit
  jarring. I never actually adjusted to it, even after weeks of seeing it.

- The treatment of units is splendid overall. It is, however, inconsistent.
  Units of distance, weight, and so on are all translated directly into their
  modern English equivalents. (This being a very American translation, the units
  are all Imperial, of course.) Reading miles instead of *stadia* and inches or
  feet instead of *cubits* was quite helpful and illuminating. On the other
  hand, the translators treated money very differently, simply leaving them in
  the original units. Perhaps they were concerned about currency fluctuations or
  the vagaries of inflation on the value of money over time. Perhaps there is no
  better way to handle monetary units, but the inconsistency remained a trifle
  jarring.

- There were a number of passages where the hermeneutical biases of the
  translators came through clearly. Their rendering of John 3:36, for example,
  supplies a great deal more than can be justified on the basis of the Greek
  text alone. The HCSB has:
	
    > The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who refuses
    > to believe in the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God remains
    > on him.
	
    The translation the HCSB is certainly one possible interpretation of the
    text, but that interpretation must be justified on the basis of many other
    texts; the plain sense of the original is as the ESV has it:
	
    > Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the
    > Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.
	
    All translation involves some degree of interpretation, but on the whole the
    HCSB translators did an admirable job of leaving ambiguities in the original
    unresolved. That made instances like this one all the more jarring---though,
    given that the HCSB is more dynamic than not, perhaps unsurprising. (The NIV
    makes almost exactly the same move as the HCSB here.) Hopefully they will
    pull it back a bit in future revisions of the text.

## Conclusion
The various issues highlighted above notwithstanding, I have enjoyed reading
through the HCSB over the last few months. It is a solid, respectable
translation and the men and women who worked on it are to be commended for their
work. Because of the quirks listed above, however, I do not expect it will
become a go-to translation for me. At the end of the day, the HCSB's "optimal
equivalence" boils down to a slightly tighter dynamic equivalence. As thigns
stand, though, I would rather use either the NIV or the NLT among the dynamic
equivalence translations---both are more consistent translations than the HCSB,
and therefore require less explanation when teaching and less mental
hoop-jumping when reading. By the same token, the ESV is a very good translation
more on the functional end of the spectrum, and certainly checks off those boxes
much more effectively than does the HCSB. Again: it is not so much that the HCSB
is a *poor* translation as that it does not do anything sufficiently *better*
than other existing translations as to displace them in my current reading and
study habits.



[^NIV]: Yes, even the NIV2011. On the gendered/inclusive language controversy, I
    basically follow D. A. Carson in _The Inclusive-Language Debate: A Plea for
    Realism_. The nature of language simply does not allow the kinds of lines
    that many conservatives (including myself in the past) have been inclined to
    draw. This becomes immediately apparent when considering translation into
    either languages without grammatical gender (even as in the case of
    English's neuter article: "the" indicates neither masculinity nor
    femininity, just like the Hebrew הַ, but unlike Greek's ὁ/ἡ/το trio) or
    languages with *more* grammatical genders. (Similarly, in his discussion of
    the "gender" of the Holy Spirit, Dan Wallace in his _Grammar_ argues
    strongly against taking the gendered pronoun in Jesus' discussion of the
    Spirit as indicative of personal gender.) This is simply bad linguistics,
    and therefore also poor theology. There is much more that could be said
    here, but in any case I do not have the problems many of my fellow
    theological conservatives do with the NIV2011.

[^optimal]: This is exactly what I mean about "optimal" equivalence: which of
    these results is *optimal*? Neither, and both! It depends on what you're
    going for!

[^poetics]: The fact of the matter is: the meaning of a poem is never so cleanly
    separable from its form. I've written about this---though too
    briefly---[before](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/mouths-of-poets.html).

[^KJV]: No Byzantine priority for me! Also, I mean no offense to the KJV
    translators, who did a truly phenomenal job. I happen to think, though, that
    *they* would be pleased to see the work of translation continue forward,
    rather than remaining fixed on their particular work.
