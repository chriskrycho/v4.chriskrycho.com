Dear Republicans: your [opposition to net neutrality][link] might be justifiable
as something other than kowtowing to megacorporations *if you ever got around to
proposing something else*. As is, all you're doing is propping up some of the
nastiest, most anti-consumer companies in the country and sustaining monopolies
and duopolies, supposedly in the name of "free markets".

**Stop it.**

N.b. This isn't intrinsically a partisan issue. It's become one, but mostly
because Republicans have felt compelled to do the bidding of the telecom
industry for... reasons.

The only thing worse than a government monopoly is a *private* monopoly.

If Republicans wanted to push for [local loop unbundling] in place of net
neutrality, *almost everyone* would be for it. (The exception: telecom
companies.)
