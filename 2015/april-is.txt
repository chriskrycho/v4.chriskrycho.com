Description: April is— / blue and gray and blue and gray and / …

| April is—
|     blue and gray and blue and gray and
|         darker gray and deeper blue and
| 
| April is—
|     gold and green and gold and green and
|         richest green and brightest gold and
| 
| April is—
|     verdant, daily changing, sometimes
|         silent, sometimes
|         cantillating, always
|             altering and new
|                 again.
