I have not (yet) made a formal list of goals for 2015, though I think I
may do so on Sunday evening. While New Years' resolutions can be silly
and get us in trouble (when we set unrealistic goals, or unhelpful
goals), the turning of the year can also be a helpful time to evaluate
the way we spend our time and the things we want to accomplish.

What follows is a list of public-ish things I am *hoping* to manage in
2015, in no particular order. Come the end of the year, I will Lord
willing look back and see which of these I was able to pull off!

- Publish at least two seasons of [Winning Slowly] with [Stephen
  Carradini][stephen] just as we did last year---but better.
- Get the site for Winning Slowly updated so that it paginates between
  seasons! This means writing an extension for [Pelican] that can
  paginate on something besides page count. An excuse to write Python? I
  call that winning.[^slowly]
- Migrate Jaimie's [Jaimie's professional writing website] from
  WordPress to [Ghost]. (Maybe do something similar with her current
  [personal site][blogspot], which runs on Blogger. Yuck.) I've gotten a
  bit of a start on that already, and I hope to knock it out sooner
  rather than later.
- Get to a point where I'm hosting all my own sites on my own
  DigitalOcean droplet (or similar). I've been moving that direction
  slowly but steadily anyway---whereas I started and ran for a long time
  on simple shared hosting, I've been using [Webfaction] for a good
  chunk of the past year, and now am pretty well ready to take the
  plunge this year into just running my own server. No skin off their
  backs; Webfaction has been great, as was [StableHost] before them. I'm
  just ready to be in control (even with the bit of extra maintenance
  that entails).[^affiliate]
- Write at least three minutes of music, and post it to my [SoundCloud]
  account. Preferably five minutes, but at least three.
- Write some poetry.
- Write a substantive essay and post it at least once a month.
- Post at least a half dozen book reviews (which, among other things,
  means reading at least a half dozen books worth reviewing). These can
  be fiction or non-fiction. Personally, I'd like to get everything from
  Dostoevsky to Schreiner in there.
- Add a picture to my [About] page!
- Post a [#family] update at least once a month. It'll be good for *me*,
  just to have a better way of tracking what's going on with our little
  gals, and I know my family would enjoy it, too.

In sum, I'd like to be doing *something* in nearly every public-facing
category in which I'm interested. Maybe it won't be a lot, but keeping
my musical skills doing matters to me. Keeping my brain engaged on a
wide variety of topics matters to me. Keeping my writing skills sharp
matters to me. I cannot *excel* at all of those things,
certainly---especially not if I wish to be a good husband and father!
But keeping them active means keeping them from further atrophying, and
that is something, at least. It will hopefully leave them more available
to me for times in the future when I am able to dedicate more time to
them.

If 2014 and 2013 were both years in which I focused primarily on
software---and all to the good!---then I hope 2015 will be a year in
which I am able to broaden out again and focus on a wider variety of
things!

You'll note that there really aren't any purely personal goals on this
list. Not to worry: I have them, and I intend to formalize them in the
next couple of days. But one of the things I have learned over the many
years I have been blogging is that not everything needs to be public.
Some things can be; indeed, some *should* be. Some things *may* be
public but *need* not, and yet others *should not* be public. Right now,
I am choosing to leave quite a few things in the "may be need not"
category private. (This direction, I can always change my mind later.
It's essentially impossible to do the opposite in the internet era.)

[^slowly]: *Slowly*. Beat you to it.

[^affiliate]: Note: those are both affiliate links; they'll give me a
    slight kickback. For StableHost, you should also use the code
    `krycho50percent` to get 50% off! I'd love it if you used it if you
    decide to sign up for either of them.
