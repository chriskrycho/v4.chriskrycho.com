N. T. Wright makes it painfully clear that it's difficult (if not impossible)
to understand Jesus without having a deep knowledge of the Old Testament:

> Equally impressive are the strong hints, throughout the gospels, that Jesus
> was modelling his ministry not on one figure alone, but on a range of
> prophets from the Old Testament. Particularly striking is his evocation of
> the great lonely figure Micaiah ben Imlach (1 Kings 22), who, when asked
> about the coming battle, predicted the death of Ahab, king of Israel, by
> saying, 'I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no
> sheperd.' Jesus, looking at the crowds, takes pity on them, because that is
> what they remind him of: leaderless sheep. Like Ezekiel, Jesus predicts that
> the temple will be abandoned by the Shekinah, left unprotected to its fate.
> Like Jeremiah, Jesus constantly runs the risk of being called a traitor to
> Israel's national apsirations, while claiming all the time that he
> nevertheless is the true spokesman for the covenant god. This, as we shall
> see, lies behind a good part of the story of Jesus' action in the Temple, and
> his subsequence 'trial': Jesus has predicted the destruction of the Temple
> and is on trial not least as a false prophet. Jesus replies to earlier
> critics and questioners with the sign of the prophet Jonah. Jonah was
> predicting immenent judgment on Nineveh, following his adventure with the
> fish; Jesus is predicting imminent judgment on Israel, and a similar sign
> will validate his message too. He is constantly redefining what the coming
> day will mean for Israel, warning her, like Amos, that it will be a day of
> darkness, not of light. Like Amos, too, he implies that the people of god
> are to be judged as the climax of the divine judgment upon all nations. The
> judgment which he announces upon Israel is sketched with the help of
> prophetic passages relating to the judgment of Jerusalem by Babylon, and
> also, more terrifyingly, passages which speak of the divine judgment upon
> Babylon itself.
> 
> Above all, Jesus adopts the style of, and consciously seems to imitate,
> Elijah. Here we are again in an interesting position _vis-à-vis_ the sources.
> It is clear from all three synoptics that they, and presumably with them the
> early church as a whole, regard John the Baptist as in some sense Elijah
> _redivivus_. They nevertheless portray Jesus as acting in Elijah-like ways,
> and show that the disciples were thinking of Elijah-typology as giving them a
> blueprint for his, and their own, activity. Jesus himself, explaining the
> nature of his work, is portrayed using both Elijah and Elisha as models.
> Again, it is highly unlikely that the early church, seeing Jesus as the
> Messiah and hence John as Elija, created this identification out of nothing.
> However, at the same time, though John himself seems to have thought that
> Jesus was to be the new Elijah, Jesus actually returned the compliment. We
> begin here to see both parallel and distinction. Jesus' ministry is so like
> that of Elijah that they can be easily confused. He too is announcing to the
> faithless people of <span class="smcp">YHWH</span> that their covenant god
> will come to them in wrath. But at the same time he is also acting out a
> different message, one of celebration and inauguration, which bursts the
> mould of the Elijah-model.
> 
> From all of this it should be clear that Jesus regarded his ministry as in
> continuity with, and bringing to a climax, the work of the great prophets of
> the Old Testament, culminating in John the Baptist, whose initiative he had
> used as his launching-pad.
