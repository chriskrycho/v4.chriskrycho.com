> No matter that Deuteronomy had envisioned it and the prophets had foretold it;
> nothing could prepare one for the ruel reality and the apparently finality of
> the situation. The burden of Lamentations is not to question why this
> happened, but to give expression to the fact that it did. At certain moments
> the book seems to look beyond the destruction, to hold out hope for the
> future, but in the end despair overcomes hope. Past and future have little
> place in the book. It centers on the "present"---the moment of trauma, the
> interminable suffering. The book is not an explanation of suffering but a
> re-creation of it and a commemoration of it.
> 
> Why immortalize this moment of destruction? Because in its own way it signals
> the truth of the Bible's theology, and it points to the continuation of the
> covenant between God and Israel....
>
> This explains why the poet can cry out to God and expect a response, why can
> vent his anger at God, why he can declare that God continues to exist even
> though his temple does not (Lam 5:18--19), why God is portrayed as so strong
> and the enemy gets no credit for the destruction. The suffering is, as it
> were, an affirmation that God is still there and still concerned with the fate
> of Israel. He may hide his face, but he has not ceased to be Israel's God.
> Lamentations contains the seeds of comfort and religious rebuilding that the
> exilic prophets (especially Second Isaiah) developed more fully in the
> aftermath of the destruction.
