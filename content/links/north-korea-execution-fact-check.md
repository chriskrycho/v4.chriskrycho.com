Summary: The story on the execution of 33 Christians in North Korea may not have been true&hellip; it is hard to tell, because we have a hard time getting information about anything in the country.

Christ and Pop Culture has some great follow-up on the link [I posted][nk] last
week:

> If you run in certain Facebook circles, you’ve likely already read that North
> Korean leader Kim Jung-un has called for the execution of 33 North Korean
> Christians. According to the widely circulated reports, these 33 people were
> detained after it was discovered they had ties to Kim Jung-wook, a South
> Korean missionary whose arrest for religious activity last year has made
> international headlines....

> But here’s the thing: No one can verify this call for executions actually took
> place.

A great example of journalism done right, and of how Christians ought to carry
ourselves in the public square. It matters whether our facts are right or not---
even when the "message" might be right either way. The [whole thing][fc] is
worth your time.
