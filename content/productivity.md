Title: Boosting My Productivity

Description: This semester, I needed to get productive, and I did. Here's how. (To-do lists, Inbox Zero, and pomodoros!)

This fall, I have had a lot on my plate: building HolyBible.com, continuing to
work for Quest Consultants, and doing a pastoral ministry internship. I needed
to be more productive---a lot more. Happily, I have been, and it only took three
small changes.[^personal]

## Use a To-Do List

Making a list of items to accomplish has been incredibly helpful. I started
using [OmniFocus] in August for class due dates and any work tasks not tracked
in other ways.[^tracker] At that point, I organized everything---a bit too much,
actually. Over the last couple months, I took some good advice I have seen in a
number of places:

  - Do not over-organize. Most tasks can go in a simple inbox.
  - Hit your due dates. Making it a habit to hit every due date will help you
    not to miss important tasks.
  - Do not put due dates on things that do not need them. You will eventually
    stop paying attention to them---and also to the due dates that *do* matter.

I try to knock out a few small things from my Inbox every day, and hit all the
due dates I set for myself. I am missing fewer things, getting more things done,
and getting them done sooner than I did before. I like my app, but I know people
who have just used an old-fashioned planner. The trick is to find a strategy
that works for you.[^app]

## Email Is *Not* A To-Do List

At some point, I got in the habit of using my email as a to-do list. In theory,
seeing a list of unanswered emails every day should have motivated me to respond
to them. In reality, they just sat there and slowly piled up. At best, they
nagged at me. At worst, I basically forgot them.

When I started using OmniFocus, I killed this habit. Now I make a task for
anything I need to act on, and I delete or archive everything else.[^email] If
the task is time-sensitive, I put a due date on it; otherwise, my third rule
above applies. I also have a repeating task reminding me to empty my inbox at
the end of each day ("Inbox Zero"). Having an empty inbox at the end of every
day removes a certain amount of mental baggage: I have a task for everything I
*need* to act on.

## Take breaks

Finally, I have started using the ["pomodoro"] technique. The basic approach is
to work steadily for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break.[^25/5] After four
such cycles, I take a slightly longer break---usually 15 minutes. On each break,
I walk around and do something unrelated to whatever I am working on. I also
write down a brief summary of what I did on that cycle.[^summary] There is
nothing complicated about this: I just use a simple timer to track the work and
break cycles.[^timer] I have seen a *dramatic* improvement in my ability to
sustain my concentration on my tasks throughout the day since I started.

There are a few reasons for that improvement. First, I have dedicated break
times, so I know that I can go check social media, read tech and news sites,
etc. *later*. That makes it easier to concentrate on work for the blocks in
between; the distractions can wait. Second, it puts a limit on those break
times. We have all been surprised to find we have lost an hour reading online;
using a timer helps prevent that. Third, getting up and moving around helps keep
my brain active---I can tell that the movement considerably improves my
alertness and concentration.

These breaks have other benefits, too. There is mounting evidence that sitting
all day is terrible for our health. Even exercising as much as I do [cannot
fully counteract][npr] a sedentary lifestyle. However, there is also evidence
that getting up and moving on a regular basis *does* help. Walking briskly, I
usually manage a fifth or a quarter of a mile on a five-minute break. That adds
up over the course of a day: if I am disciplined about walking on my breaks, I
regularly walk 2--3 miles in a day, even with lunch and other non-walking breaks
in the mix.

I have also found the breaks spiritually helpful. One of the requirements for my
pastoral ministry internship was to memorize Ephesians. Five-minute breaks are
*perfect* for memorizing and reviewing Scripture, so I was able to be productive
on those breaks, even while letting my brain relax from my other work. It is
similarly useful for dedicated times of prayer throughout the day. The
combination of scripture memory and prayer has been invaluable in combatting sin
and stirring up my affections for Christ.

In short, I get a triple benefit by doing pomodoros. I am more productive when I
am working, my body will remain healthier because I am less sedentary, and I am
growing in holiness and intimacy with God. Of all the changes I made this
semester, incorporating pomodoros into my day has been the most important, and I
plan to make it a regular part of my life henceforth.

[^personal]: This is just what I do. It may not work for you. It may even drive
    you crazy.

[^tracker]: I.e., things not covered by JIRA, Trello, Bitbucket issues, etc.

[^app]: While [OmniFocus] suits me, I would recommend [Todoist] to most people
    instead: it is less expensive and easier to use, and while it does not do
    *everything* OmniFocus does, it can easily do everything most people need.

[^email]: I archive order confirmations, messages from friends, and work
    conversations, and delete everything else.

[^25/5]: Why the 25/5 pattern? That seems to be a limit in human cognition; it
    lines up closely with research on student attention spans in the classroom.

[^timer]: I have used [Tomighty] and [Pomodoro One], which are both free and
    work well. The app is not the point, though: an old-fashioned kitchen timer
    will do just as well.

[^summary]: This helps me see what I have done over the course of a day and
    gives me a sense of progress. It is also extremely useful when writing up a
    weekly report for an employer.
