| 'Tis easier, I confess,
|     to speak of savor than
|         in truth to taste
|             the goodness of our Savior
|             the sweetness of our God
|     to call to revel than
|         in truth to dance
|             for joy at what he's done
|             for hope in what he'll do
|     to write of change than
|         in truth to alter
|             habits of thought and deed
|             patterns of word and way

| These words will not suffice---
| no poetry alone will change produce---
| yet as a reminder and a warning,
| rhythm and letters on a page will do,
| and I will strive:
|     to savor and to taste,
|     to revel and to dance,
|     to alter and to change.
