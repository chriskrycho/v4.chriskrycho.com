| The mirror begins to show me lines
| around my lips and across my brow
| but I shall not mind their steady growth
| so long as they are mostly wonder
| with compassion mixed, and joy writ bold
| 'til by God's grace an agéd man
| I wear deep these marks of life well-lived:
| not scars, but prizes, fought hard and won
| and full of hope for others after
| (who may likewise four-score years do good)
| and bright countenance bear to that end
| which but another beginning be.
