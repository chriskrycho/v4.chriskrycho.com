> What I would like to suggest about the effect of the language of poetry in
> this [Isa. 1:2--9] and most other Biblical prophecies is that it tends to lift
> the utterances to a second power of signification, aligning statements that
> are addressed to a concrete historical situation with an archetypal horizon.
> The Judean contemporaries of Isaiah the son of Amoz become the archetypes
> Sodom and Gomorrah in respect to both their collective destiny and their moral
> character. If one considers, as the metaphors of the poem require one to
> consider, how God has treated them as beloved sons, then their exploitation of
> the poor and the helpless in their midst (1:23 and elsewhere), in flagrant
> violation of God's commands, becomes a paradigmatic instance of treachery, of
> man's... capacity for self-destructive perverseness. In this fashion, a
> set of messages framed for a particular audience of the eighth century B.C.E.
> Is not just the transcription of a historical document but continues to speak
> age after age, inviting members of otherwise very different audiences to read
> themselves into the text.
