The resurrection exclaims that the present way of things is not final---that cancer and depression and futility will someday pass away and be done with once and for all. The broken world will be restored, every tear wiped away, every sickness of body and mind healed, every sin defeated. It says this because the resurrection is a historical reality, not merely a mystical hope. Jesus the son of Mary was dead, and then he was no longer dead. His lungs---once pierced by a spear, then deflated in death---breathed again. His heart beat again. He ate again. He lived.
