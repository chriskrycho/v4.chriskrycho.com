Whether people are born guilty of sin, or simply inherit a nature so predisposed
to sin that the actual act is inevitable has been a much debated topic for
generations. In my view, however, the question is impossible to answer. I do not
think Scripture speaks with sufficient clarity on the matter. We know on the one
hand that all are "by nature children of wrath" (Ephesians 2:3), and that "all
have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). What neither of
these texts tell us, though, and what indeed *no* text tells us, is whether
people are guilty at birth or whether they are simply sinful and become guilty.

We could reason to a conclusion that accords with our other theological
commitments with little difficulty. We know that God is just, and punishes for
the wrongs we commit, but we have no evidence that he punishes wrongs we *might*
commit, and therefore we might conclude that he would therefore not find guilty
any newly conceived or newly born person. On the other hand, we also must reckon
with the reality that the Scriptures treat questions of progeny far differently
than do individually-minded modern Westerners.

Scripture points us to the God who "will by no means clear the guilty, visiting
the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the
third and the fourth generation" (Exodus 34:7) as well as the God who proclaims
that "The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of
the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son" (Ezekiel 18:20).
Paul did write that "one trespass led to condemnation for all men," but he
immediately follows up this provocative statement by arguing that "one act of
righteousness leads to justification and life for all men" (Romans 5:18)---yet
we know that Paul does not (and cannot) here mean that all men are saved, for we
know that he believes that those who do not repent and believe the gospel perish
in their sins under the expectation of judgment.

We cannot from the evidence that God has given us decide this question. We are
left without an answer. If we grant the sufficiency of Scripture, then we must
recognize that if there are questions God has in his wisdom opted not to answer,
it is for a reason, and we should cease with our speculations and be silent. We
may not know whether infants are *guilty*, but we do know two other things that
are far more important than that: First, God is merciful and gracious and just.
We will not in the final reckoning find his justice lacking or his treatment of
(for example) those who died in infancy to be lacking. Second, all are born
under the dual curse of sin's hold and death's certainty.

These truths give us clear and straightforward points of application. First, we
must preach the gospel clearly to people of every age and intellectual ability,
for even little children sin and death is awaiting us all. Whether or not we are
born guilty, we *become* guilty very quickly. Second, much of the speculation on
this question---and many churches practices such as infant baptism---seems to be
rooted in worry about the fate of those who die young, without having made a
credible profession of faith. Yet even if we *did* know the answer to the
question of their guilt, we still might not know God's response. Even did we
know the answer, still we would need learn to trust in the goodness and wisdom
of God in this matter.
