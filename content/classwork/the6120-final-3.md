Title: The Nature of Justification (redux)
Summary: Justification is one of the essential elements of our salvation, and while it is not less than judicial right standing before God, it is more&mdash;much more.

Put most simply, to be justified is to be *right* with God---to be "righteous".

Being right with God is a complex and multifaceted reality. To understand it,
however, one must understand how *God* is just and righteous, because Christian
righteousness is *Christ's* righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21). God's
righteousness is intrinsic to him; it is expressed in his righteous deeds, most
especially in judging justly. His justice, in turn, is expressed in the most
gracious and merciful manner imaginable: he punished sin and defeated death in
himself, rather than in the people who deserved punishment and had brought death
on themselves. Moreover, he also removes the power of sin in their lives so that
they ultimately may *stop* breaking fellowship with him and each other and may
stop acting in such a way as to earn the penalty of sin (death). So God's
justice and righteousness are seen in that he restores people to unbroken
relationship with him, removes from them not only their guilt but their
brokenness and inevitable tendency toward sin.

If this is the righteousness that is granted to Christians in Christ, then it is
more than (though not less than) a change in judicial state before God.
Christians have forensic justification in Christ---they are declared "not
guilty" in him---because they are united with him. Colossians 2:9--14 drives
home this connection clearly: believers are filled in Christ, buried in death
and raised to life with him in baptism. This new life and participation in
Christ is then the grounds of God's setting aside the legal demands that stood
against the believer: they are nailed to the cross because Christ was nailed to
the cross and the believer *is in Christ*. All trespasses are forgiven, because
the believer is no longer operating under his own nature but is full of Christ,
and in Christ the fullness of God dwells bodily.

So then to be justified, to be made right with God, is to have all of Christ's
righteousness as *actually* one's own. It is not a legal fiction, but a
spiritual reality. The believer is right with God; he may not always live in
accord with this reality, but he is. By analogy: a husband is always married to
his wife; even if he strays by cheating on her, he remains truly married to her.

This view of justification cuts off at its core any kind of works-righteousness
view of righteousness. The righteousness that believers possess is always
entirely God's righteousness mediated to them by the Spirit through their
participation in the resurrected Son. It is not, as in the Roman Catholic view,
participatory righteousness in which the believer contributes his own
righteousness (even if by faith and the Spirit's power) and the remainder is
accomplished by God. Nor is it that God *chooses* to see the believer as if he
is righteous when in actuality he is not (yet) righteous because sanctification
is incomplete. Rather, no part of the believer's righteousness---right state,
and not only right standing---is his own. Rather, it is always all of God. When
acting righteously, one *demonstrates* that one is justified, but whoever is in
Christ is already truly righteous.
