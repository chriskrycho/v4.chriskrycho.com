Title: Not Exactly a Millennium
Subtitle: Reading Revelation 20 in its Context
Summary: >
    Revelation's description of a millennial reign for saints and chaining of
    Satan is not intended to outline a millennial doctrine (a-, pre-, or post-),
    but rather signals in literary and symbolic fashion the assurance of God's
    power over Satan and the reward for his saints.

## Introduction
Few books are as perplexing to modern readers as Revelation, and few matters
within it as controversial as the nature of the millennium. As one commentator
put it, "Judging from the amount of attention given by many writers to the first
ten verses of chapter 20, one would think they were the single most important
section of the book of Revelation."[^1] The three major millennial
readings---pre-, a-, and postmillennial---divide on how to read the sequence.
Both amillennial and postmillennial interpretations affirm that Christ will
return at the end of the millennium and that there will be a single
resurrection, whereas the premillennial interpretation anticipates Christ
returning to *inaugurate* the millennium, raising (some or all of) the saints at
that time and then raising all who remain at the end of the millennium for final
judgment. This paper will argue that John did not in fact intend to establish a
totally new doctrine of a millennium (of any sort) in this much-debated
sequence, but rather intended to succor his audience with the hope of God's
faithfulness to his promises. That is: the millennial passage indicates not a
duration of time---not even an indeterminate sequence as in some idealist or
historicist readings---but rather depicts symbolically and numerologically the
fulfillment of the promises made to the saints elsewhere in Revelation and the
rest of Scripture. In particular, he draws on imagery and the recapitulatory
pattern established in Ezekiel 37--48,[^2] presenting the same conflict multiple
times from different angles to emphasize the sovereignty of God and the surety
of his salvation and vindication of his saints.

## Context
Revelation was most likely written by John the Apostle from exile on the island
of Patmos in the early-to-mid-90s A.D., though it is impossible to be certain of
either authorship or provenance.[^3] The churches which constituted John's
audience---the seven addressees of the letters that opened the book---were
facing a history of persecution and the threat of future persecution. As early
as the 60s A.D., the church had faced serious persecution under Nero, and it
continued to face varying degrees of opposition in the years that followed. The
book served then---and has served the church ever since---as an exhortation to
endure and an encouragement that whatever trials come, God will accomplish
justice in the end and vindicate his saints.[^4]

Although the purpose of the book is thus relatively clear, it remains difficult
to interpret because of outstanding questions regarding its genre and structure.
The book opens and closes in epistolary fashion; it declares itself to be a
prophecy; and it is explicitly titled an apocalypse and bears all the hallmarks
of the genre.[^5] As with many apocalypses, and like the Old Testament
prophecies on which it is modeled and from which it draws, the book functions
not merely as revelation, but also (and perhaps primarily) as exhortation---thus
the epistolary frame and the consistent thematic warning against idolatry.[^6]
As with apocalyptic literature in general, the book is heavy on imagery,
metaphor, and symbolic representations. As such, it conveys its message at the
three distinct levels of *visionary*, *historical* or *referential*, and
*symbolic*.[^7] Leaping directly from the visionary to the referential level
without considering the symbolic meanings will certainly lead to
misinterpretation within the genre. Indeed, the book itself indicates that it
conveys its message primarily through symbols.[^8] Thus, right interpretation of
the text must respect literary convention and take care not to leap from the
content of John's vision to a proposed referent without considering how
symbolism may be at play.

## Exegesis
The millennial passage does not stand alone, but is part of the final,
conclusive judgment cycle, beginning in 19:11 and concluding at the end of
chapter 20. The sequence is comprised of five "And I saw..."[^9] sequences,
which begin in 19:11, 19:17, 20:1, 20:4, and 20:11. The millennium itself is
introduced in 20:2--3 and discussion of the millennium carries on through the
final defeat of Satan after his release "when the thousand years are ended"
(20:7).[^10]  After God's final crushing victory over Satan, the scene turns to
eternal judgment at the great white throne. Throughout the entire final
sequence, he draws heavily on the narrative, language, and imagery of Ezekiel
37--48. Thus, John's cycle of judgment passages leads directly into a discussion
of the new Jerusalem, just as Ezekiel's judgment sequence leads into his lengthy
treatment of the future, eschatological temple.[^11] Finally, John synthesizes
these images from both Ezekiel with eschatological language from Isaiah,
combining the two great visions into a unified whole. This pattern, and the
imagery layered throughout, should both caution the reader from interpreting the
sequence in strict chronological fashion---Ezekiel's treatment is expressly
recapitulatory[^12]---and suggest that John's intent may be comment and
synthesis rather than the formulation of a wholly new doctrine.

### 19:11--21: A Climactic Battle with the Beast and the False Prophet
John opens this final section of the book with two visions. The first
(19:11--16) is an image of Christ as the divine warrior, the Word of God, whose
word destroys the enemies of God. The second (19:17--21) is of the defeat of
those enemies and a horrifying feast---the dreadful inverse of the wedding
supper of the Lamb.[^13] Here is the first of several significant clues that the
millennial passage that follows *recapitulates* rather than *follows* this
battle. Throughout the book, with the sole exception of the appearance of
nations in glory in the conclusion, "the nations" (τὰ ἐθνῆ) appear to the
rebellious nations in contrast with the saints[^14]---and the nations are
*completely* destroyed here. The beast and false prophet are thrown into the
lake of fire (19:20), and "the rest were slain by the sword that came from the
mouth of him who was sitting on the horse" (19:21). The deceived nations that
join Satan in Satan in his post-millennial war must be understood in light of
this destruction.

### 20:1--6: The Millennium---Satan Bound, Saints Reigning with Christ
In 20:1--3, John describes an angel binding Satan and locking him in an abyss
for a thousand years. In vv. 4--6, he describes the "first resurrection" and the
thousand-year reign of the martyrs-and-saints with Christ.[^15] On the one hand,
the language used here for binding Satan seems fairly strong: the angel binds
him, then shuts him in the Abyss and seals and locks it.[^16] On the other hand,
this is not the first place where the New Testament speaks of Satan's being
bound (cf. especially Mark 3:27 and the parallel in Matt. 12:29, Luke 19:17--18,
John 12:31, Col. 2:15).[^17] Nor is it the first place where angelic forces
defeat Satan and restrain his power (cf. Rev. 12).[^18] The angel binds Satan,
and the point seems to be the *effect* and *efficacy* rather than the *extent*
of the binding: to prevent Satan from deceiving the nations and from assaulting
the saints, until the climactic final battle.[^19] It also establishes God's
rule: Satan is powerless to resist.[^20]

After describing Satan's binding, John turns his attention (another "and I saw")
to saints sharing in the first resurrection. Notably, these saints are seated on
thrones, and John has used the language of martyr-saints and thrones before (see
6:9ff).[^21] The word "throne" appears some forty-seven times in the book, and
apart from references to Satan's or the beast's rule, all of them (save perhaps
these) unambiguously refer to heaven, *not* earth.[^22] The link strongly
suggests that the scene is not the earth in some future age, but heaven, and
reinforces the notion that John is recapitulating material he has covered
before, rather than continuing sequentially from what preceded in the text.

John's language of the "first resurrection" (20:6) and the ingressive use of
preterite ζάω, "They came to life..." and "the rest... did not come to life"
(20:4--5) are perhaps the strongest arguments in favor of a premillennial
reading of the passage. The language suggests bodily resurrection, and indeed it
is unusual for the same word to be used first of spiritual and then of physical
resurrection only a few phrases apart.[^23] However, there are reasons within
the text itself to think this is not John's point. The first resurrection here
includes all of, but only, the righteous; and the second all of, but only, the
unrighteous.[^24] Similarly, and more conclusively, the *second death* that
parallels the (implied but never mentioned!) second resurrection[^25] is at
least primarily spiritual, while the first is clearly physical; it is therefore
possible the inverse is true of the resurrections.[^26] The kind of "coming to
life" on display here is thus not *necessarily* final resurrection, but
spiritual life in the interval between Christ's comings.

More broadly, the literary tenor of the passage warrants caution beyond even
that already suggested by the apocalyptic setting. The passage is saturated in
symbolism and imagery: "chain," "key," "Abyss," "dragon," "ancient serpent,"
"locked," and "sealed" are all certainly images representing realities, rather
than literal depictions of those realities.[^27] Given ten's association with
completeness or perfection, the use of its third power is clearly symbolic as
well.[^28] Moreover, John here draws on imagery that was already prevalent in
the apocalyptic literature that formed the context of his audience's
expectation. The notion of a Messianic millennium was not his invention, though
he did bring it to bear in a unique context within the Christian canon.[^29] To
suggest, then, that these "thousand years" *must* be taken as a literal
depiction of time, regardless of how often John repeats it, is to mistake the
literary context and John's intended meaning.[^30] *All* the numbers in
Revelation appear to have a figurative rather than literal referent.[^31]
Indeed, any directly literal approach to the millennium is necessarily "an
incredible way to treat numbers in an apocalypse!"[^32]

Thus, a symbolic reading of the thousand years seems best---and not only in the
sense that the time period in view is not literally one thousand years, but also
in the sense that it points to something other than a physical reign of the
martyr-saints on earth entirely. One of the functions of the millennium, on any
reading, is to demonstrate both Satan's and the nations' lack of repentance.
Neither does a thousand years of being restrained chasten Satan whatsoever, nor
does that interval where Satan is restrained change the hearts of rebellious men
and women.[^33] Both Satan and rebellious humanity vindicate God's judgment
against them.

### 20:7--10: A Climactic Battle with Satan
Not itself a distinct section,[^34] the final war with Satan recapitulates
material already covered in Revelation 16--19, and also links back to both of
the immediately preceding "and I saw" sections.[^35] Here is one of the major
clues that John is not building a theology of the millennium: the climactic
defeat of Satan here directly echoes the previous defeat at Armageddon (16:14)
and the defeat of the beast and false prophet (see above).[^36] Indeed "the war"
(ὁ πόλεμος) appears only here, at 16:14, and 19:19 in the book, further tying
them together.[^37] As noted above, the nations were utterly destroyed in the
battle in 19:17--21, yet appear again here as Satan's pawns only to be destroyed
completely again. Even commentators who suppose a basically premillennial
outlook therefore grant that the sequence of events with the nations here is
difficult to make chronological sense of in premillennial terms.[^38] This is
the same battle, with the same enemies, and the same outcome. John is indeed
following Ezekiel's outline; like the prophet, he retells the same battle from
two angles. Just as the beast and false prophet deceived the nations and led
them to destruction, Satan deceives the nations only to lead them to
destruction. Indeed, this serves as the conclusion to a large-scale chiasm
running from the beginning of ch. 12. John introduces Satan, the beast and the
false prophet, and Babylon, and in turn God judges Babylon, the beast and the
false prophet, and finally Satan.[^39]

This outcome is as expected, in light of the rest of the book and especially the
preceding section it so clearly echoes. There, Christ defeated the Beast and the
false prophet utterly; here God defeats Satan utterly. No actual battle appears
in either case: God's and Christ's victory is immediate and without
contest.[^40] Satan's deception comes to an end once and for all, every one of
his tools (whether the harlot, the false prophet and the beast, or the
rebellious nations of the earth) unable to stand before God.[^41] As in Ezekiel,
the rebellious nations are destroyed in the first telling with a sword, in the
second telling with fire.[^42] Likewise, the end of Satan's deceptions of the
nations culminates in his being thrown into the lake of fire, just as were the
other deceivers in ch. 19.[^43] The millennium is not a sequence *following* the
war against the saints, but a second image of the time that *leads up to* that
final confrontation.

### After: Judgment, Then Consummation
After Satan's defeat, the living and the dead are judged, and those whose names
are not found in the book of life are subjected to the second death---this one
spiritual, joining the beast, the false prophet, and Satan in the lake of fire.
Notably, the dead who are judged have not gone previously to the lake of fire
here---unlike the rest of the New Testament's expectation that the dead will be
judged immediately at Christ's return.[^44] At the last, Death and Hades join
them (just as in 1 Cor. 15:26).[^45] Again: these are symbolic images; the
visionary content cannot be translated into future-historical referents directly
and without interpretation. These conclusive events *do* help resolve the point
of the millennium itself, though: they align all the final judgments together,
synchronize John's telling with the Ezekiel narration he is interpreting. Thus,
John turns immediately after the judgment to the final vision of the book: the
New Jerusalem, and the new Heavens and new Earth, and the descent of God to
dwell with humanity forever. As in Ezekiel, the focus is on the shape of the
future temple, as a symbol of the perfect restoration of God's place of
fellowship with humanity---only magnified manifold even beyond Ezekiel's vision.
Further, John's integration of Isaianic imagery here into the new
Jerusalem/heaven and earth strongly militates against interpreting Isaiah 65 as
pointing to a millennial age.[^46] The turn to this massively perfect
garden-city-temple emphasizes the finality of God's eschatological work. It also
further demonstrates that John's concern, unlike so many commentators, was not
the establishment of a doctrine of a millennium. Rather, John sought to make
clear that God's victory would be final and complete, that justice would be done
in the world, and that the saints would have the reward he promised them.

## Concern
The church may err---indeed, *has* erred---in several ways in its interpretation
of the Apocalypse. One the one hand, she may swerve into the kind of
sensuousness attributed to Papias and others early in the history of the church,
prompting Origin and Augustine to take a purely spiritual reading of the
millennium, with the Reformers following them. On the other hand, the church has
sometimes carried this idealized reading into spiritualizing away Christ's
return. Neither of these are good. John's millennium is not a literal thousand
years, nor even an unspecified-but-lengthy period of time when the former saints
reign in resurrected bodies on a still-fallen earth, with sin yet-unjudged, over
others who are still mortal and can reject salvation.[^47] But it is not a
throwaway idea, and it should not lead the church to mischaracterize *other*
elements of John's eschatology.

John uses this language not to outline a new eschatological doctrine, but to
shine light on an old one: God's work overthrowing the powers of the present age
in his Messiah's incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension. He
reiterates what he and others have already said: Satan's power to deceive the
nations has been broken, because the strong man came and bound him.[^48] Christ
is reigning *now* (Hebrews 1:3--4), though there is a greater reign yet to come.
Moreover, the broader context of the book makes clear that John's point here is
not to suggest some future half-way stop between fall and glory. Rather, he
assures saints that even now, Satan's hatred and lies are restrained---however
fierce they may seem at times. As such, the saints can stand fast in the face of
whatever trials they face.

There are two major implications of this reading for the life of the church.
First, and foundational for the second, Revelation as a book and this passage
specifically have something to say to the church *today*. These are not merely
vague notions about an unknown future, which confuse rather than comfort.
Instead, they are a symbolic (but for that no less *true*) proclamation of the
reign of Jesus Christ, the Ancient of Days, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords
who will one day let Satan loose only to destroy him and his evil utterly.
Secondly, therefore, the church should *preach* this book, and regularly. John's
promises about the future will lead the church now to stand fast when the
surrounding world calls for compromise and the temptation to idolatry rears its
head, as it does in every generation. Satan is bound; Christ reigns *now*, and
the saints with him; and someday Christ will come again, judge the living and
the dead once for all, and consummate his kingdom. "Here is a call for the
endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith
in Jesus" (Rev. 14:12). The indicative---Christ reigns, Satan is bound---prompts
an imperative: life as if this is so![^49] Come temptations to materialism, or
the worship of ancestors, or nationalism, or any other idolatry, Christians
proclaim Christ alone is Lord.
