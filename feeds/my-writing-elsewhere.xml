&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Christian in the world of podcasting—I have both a “two dudes talking” show (Winning Slowly) and also a “one dude talking with maybe a brief musical intro and outro” show (New Rustacean)—I found much to agree with, but also much to clarify and a few things to disagree with…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a set of theses on podcasting as a medium. Some of these are obvious; none are intended to be tendentious. Some of them warrant further explanation—for which, see below….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After which, &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/theses-on-podcasting/"&gt;32 theses (and another ~3,000 words)&lt;/a&gt; on the constraints and challenges of podcasting as a medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: the format of this particular piece is heavily inspired by Jacobs’ own &lt;a href="http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/Infernal_Machine/2015/03/79-theses-on-technology-for-disputation/"&gt;“79 Theses on Technology. For Disputation.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reading John J. O’Keefe and R. R. Reno’s Sanctified Vision for the independent study on hermeneutics and theological method I am doing this summer. I have found the book fairly helpful overall, and think the authors are right to commend the church Fathers as models for Biblical interpretation in many ways. The authors do good (albeit somewhat tendentious) work arguing for whole-Bible/“intensive reading” strategies and the validity of typology as part of theological method. When they come to allegory, though, their argument almost immediately goes off the rails with a deeply misguided interpretation of The Lord of the Rings….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the rest &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/misreading-tolkien-hermeneutics-allegory-lord-rings/"&gt;over at Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week saw the premiere of Darren Aronofsky’s &lt;em&gt;Noah&lt;/em&gt;, and with it a (predictable) storm of controversy from the evangelical community. Reviews have ranged from &lt;a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2014/03/31/drowning-in-distortion-darren-aronofskys-noah/"&gt;predictably critical&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/churchofthemasses/2014/03/the-utter-embarrassing-mess-of-noah-and-why-everybody-is-lying-about-it/"&gt;outright disdain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://drbrianmattson.com/journal/2014/3/31/sympathy-for-the-devil"&gt;hostile readings&lt;/a&gt;, and from &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/march-web-only/noah.html?paging=off"&gt;strongly (though not unreservedly) positive&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://convergemagazine.com/noah-film-12561/"&gt;more restrained restrained affirmation&lt;/a&gt; of the film on &lt;a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/film/noah"&gt;aesthetic and spiritual&lt;/a&gt; grounds to especially measured &lt;a href="http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/3036/inoahi_a_theological_reflection.aspx"&gt;theological&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://christandpopculture.com/stars-strange-review-noah/"&gt;artistic engagement&lt;/a&gt;. In short, the responses spanned exactly the range one would expect from the evangelical community, which is itself deeply divided on the purpose, value, and meaning of the arts—decades of conversation on the topic notwithstanding. &lt;em&gt;Noah&lt;/em&gt; works as a sort of theological-artistic Rorschach test. We seem to find it in what we expect given its origins and our disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than offer another review (which would add nothing to the conversation at this point), or decry once again the predictable evangelical response to the arts, or even critique reviews with which I disagreed, I thought it might be useful instead to ask where we stand today and point to a few places we might grow from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you’ll find &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/noah-theological-aesthetic-rorschach-test/"&gt;the rest of the piece&lt;/a&gt; salient and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been common these past few years to speak of “incarnational theology” as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: we ought to “incarnate” Christ to the world as Christ “incarnated” the Godhead to us. There is much to appreciate in this sentiment…. Yet for all that, I think that applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation matters, and it matters as more than a means of getting Jesus to the cross so that he could die for our sins. We evangelicals too often reduce everything to penal substitutionary atonement. Yes, the atonement is incredible and amazing. It is one of the central affirmations and joys of the Christian faith: our sins are paid for! Glory to God! But Jesus did more than that, and he is worthy of yet more praise. He did not stop at paying the price for our sins while leaving our bodies subject to corruption. He did not content himself with performing a judicial act while leaving our wills broken, certain to turn again to the same sin that led to our death in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/god-become-man-richer-theology-incarnation/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the best thing I’ve written so far this year; I hope you find it stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;
