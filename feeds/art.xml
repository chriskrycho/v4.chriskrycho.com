&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended:&lt;/strong&gt; this is good sci-fi—the kind that makes you think while also being a bit of a page-turner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim Stanley Robinson comes highly recommended, so in a moment of overwhelming need to read science fiction the other evening, I snagged a novel of his in ebook form, and read it over the weekend. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember being 6? I have only the barest glimmers of it. An image will come rushing back sometimes, of something I experienced then—a moment of delight, or horror, all at once, full of sensation and bright color and feeling. Or a smell will bring something from my teenage years back: cut grass makes me think of two-a-day practices for football, without fail. But the past is behind me in a way that is hard to describe, and which I have often thought about, but rarely so much as in the days I was reading (and in the days since finished reading) this little novel about the politics of Mars and a slowly-colonizing Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;Icehenge&lt;/em&gt;, its name notwithstanding, really isn’t much at all about a massive Stonehenge-like construction, all of ice, on Pluto. It’s about memory, and what it would be like to live to 600 in a body that ages slowly but with a mind still incapable of holding on to the past, and the stories we tell to make sense of the world, and the hunger for truth, and the things that get in the way of the pure pursuit of the truth, and power, and loneliness, and what the past means and how we get at it in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect to be reading considerably more of KSR.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want the TL;DR, this is it:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a beautiful book—not, perhaps, for everyone, but truly delightful for its intended audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beren and Lúthien&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful collection detailing the progression of what was perhaps J. R. R. Tolkien’s personally most-treasured tale he wrote. This slim little volume was also likely the last of Tolkien’s works to be published by his now very-old son Christopher, who has made the history of his father’s literary creation his own latter life’s work. At 92, he is (as he notes in this volume’s foreword) unlikely to publish any more material. This was a good note to end on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not a book I would hand to just anyone. As a picture of the development of one of the central tales in Tolkien’s legendarium, it is fascinating—though little of the material is new; much of it was presented already in the various histories Christopher Tolkien compiled over the past decades. For a casual reader of fantasy, or even a casual fan of Tolkien himself, it is unlikely to be interesting at all. But for those who love Tolkien’s work, and especially those who love this particular tale, this is a little treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version of the tale in &lt;em&gt;The Silmarillion&lt;/em&gt; is quite beautiful in its own right—I read it aloud to Jaimie many years ago, on a night when the only thing that would calm baby Ellie was the combination of Jaimie holding her and the sound of my voice, and it made Jaimie weep. Tolkien could do that. But the version in which his elegant and lyrical tone finds its fullest expression (and the best version of the tale) is here, in &lt;em&gt;The Lay of Leithian&lt;/em&gt;. The love story in poetic form—sadly, unfinished—is utterly lovely. I couldn’t have been happier, in literary terms, than when I was reading its many lines of coupled verse.&lt;/p&gt;

This week, since I’m taking some time off, I got to participate! The prompt was: &lt;em&gt;Write a story about trees which whisper poems to those who know how to hear them. (It’s not allowed to be scary.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her first question was: “Who taught the trees to speak?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her second, of course, was: “Any why only in such &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; poetry?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t always know about the whispers, and of course I didn’t believe old Dallet when he told me about it, and it took me six weeks to hear them for the first time myself—so I didn’t particularly expect Annyth to hear them immediately after I mentioned them to her. I probably should have. She’d always been a little odd. But whatever the reason, she just blinked those round not-quite-brown, not-quite-green eyes at me a few times, like some slightly startled owl caught out in daylight, and then giggled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For good reason: the spruces had just started in on a ridiculous ditty about nymphs—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They dance like dancers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and twirl like twirlers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and all the little nymphs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;are sort of like curlers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;but sans the ice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and add a dash of spice…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the idea. The &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; kinds of puns and rhymes, for hours on end. Annyth’s second question had good cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I’d gotten lost in my own mind again, listening to the rhymes, because she repeated her questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who taught the trees to speak? Any why only in such &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; poetry?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged. “No one knows who taught them. Maybe they’ve always known.” She somehow managed to furrow her brows &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; quirk them at me at the same time. “Okay, probably not, but Dallet said his grandfather taught him, and that &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; great-uncle taught him, and so on back a thousand years, and either the first one forgot to tell anyone that he was the one responsible for it all, or everyone else—”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Heard this terrible poetry and decided to make sure his name didn’t live on at all?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed. “Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nymph poem had ended; now they were onto something about stream beds…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It runs, so cool, down through the bed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And even though, the stream, it has no head&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It likes to lie down in its bed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Until it comes to make us fed…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned away from the trees for a moment and looked at me. “Is it… &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; this bad?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged again. “Not… &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now her eyebrows were &lt;em&gt;raised&lt;/em&gt; and quirked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean, sometimes it’s actually worse. When they start telling limericks… just stop up your ears. But every once in a while some tree or another will start up a sonnet and you’ll get those fourteen lines of decency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smirked. “A sonnet? Tree love poems?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged again. I seemed to be doing a lot of that today. “As far as tree love poems go, honestly, the sonnets are preferable. Sappy but not… weird.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the eyebrows went completely flat. “I don’t think I want to know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t, but you probably will, soon enough. Now that you’ve heard them, you’ll never be able to &lt;em&gt;unhear&lt;/em&gt; them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?” The eyebrows were climbing again. “Don’t they stop?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smiled my &lt;em&gt;worried&lt;/em&gt; smile at her. “What, exactly, do you think you’re hearing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eyebrows furrowed for a moment again as she listened, then twitched and quivered a moment in what looked like consternation, then rose until I thought they would come entirely off the top of her head. “No. No no no no no.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged. Again. &lt;em&gt;Stop shrugging, idiot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s the &lt;em&gt;wind&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded, smiled my &lt;em&gt;sympathetic, just-one-side-of-my-mouth quirked&lt;/em&gt; smile at her. “And when was the last time you heard a day without a breeze?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annyth shook her head. Her eyebrows were darting furiously this way and that. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such versatile eyebrows, truly. She started breathing a little faster. Her eyes were darting to match her eyebrows. “You mean to tell me that you thought it would be &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; to subject me to these awful, awful rhymes for the &lt;em&gt;rest of my life&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s what you said, you…” she paused, listened for a moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;like a jolly little man with no brain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;he dances across the plain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and does a dance, a sprightly jig&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;as if he were a baboon grown over big&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You little man with no brain, you baboon grown over big!” The eyebrows were low and fierce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I… shrugged. &lt;em&gt;Again.&lt;/em&gt; What was it with the shrugs today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annyth paused. “They weren’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; singing that about you, were they?” Now the eyebrows were in thinking posture: left furrowed more than right, right slightly quirked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried desperately to keep my shoulders from moving. No more shrugs. “I… honestly don’t know. I’ve never really paid attention to why the songs change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annyth stared at me like I were a complete dunce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He does not see, he has no eyes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Though stare out from his face they do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He listens to winds and hears but lies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Though every day he hears the truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My&lt;/em&gt; eyes went wide. &lt;em&gt;Her&lt;/em&gt; eyes went wide. We looked at the trees. I swallowed. “That was… just a coincidence, don’t you think?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shivered, looked at her. Her hazel owl eyes stared back wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it whispered in the spruce trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We breathed. “Ask what?” Annyth whispered back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Ten thousand years&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call and response: the oaks were answering the spruce trees with a low flutter to the whisper in the needles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Just one question&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Ignored, unheard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Why do you have ears&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;And we speak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;And you listen not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence, again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at Annyth, ran my tongue across my bottom teeth, shrugged (of course), and mouthed, “Ask?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She giggled. The sound startled in the silence, but still the trees stood waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cleared my throat. “Ask what?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She rolled her eyes at me. “Who taught you to speak?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, like a whispered shout in the gathering dusk, spruce and oak in chorus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smiled at me. “When?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;At beginning times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;At start of age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
       &lt;em&gt;At end of unseeing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyebrows wide, Annyth asked: “Why?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annyth’s eyes were bright with joy, and round; her eyebrows high again. I shrugged uncomprehending. “Don’t you hear?” she said. “We just keep asking. That’s what we do. Until we find the truth. We keep asking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poetry ran on. But no more folly. Now it had &lt;em&gt;answers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

do at times perplex me&lt;br /&gt;
for we are not, or not especially,&lt;br /&gt;
mindful of the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is charged, they say, charged with wonder,&lt;br /&gt;
and I suppose it must be&lt;br /&gt;
for this is a world where God became a man,&lt;br /&gt;
and died, and lived again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every day seems a day like another,&lt;br /&gt;
even Easter morning&lt;br /&gt;
Because we do still live in the time&lt;br /&gt;
between the times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ is risen!&lt;br /&gt;
    —and we still die, and mourn&lt;br /&gt;
        (but not without hope)—&lt;br /&gt;
Christ will come again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is why we meet&lt;br /&gt;
this is why we sing&lt;br /&gt;
and tell each other again&lt;br /&gt;
the old story, as if new&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that on gray days like every other&lt;br /&gt;
even Easter morning&lt;br /&gt;
We remember, though still in the time&lt;br /&gt;
between the times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ is risen!&lt;br /&gt;
    —and we will live, and dance&lt;br /&gt;
       (when we see our hope)—&lt;br /&gt;
Christ will come again!&lt;/p&gt;

We decided to do a little writing challenge! The rules of our challenge were: we had 30 minutes to write at least 500 words, it had to be fantasy, it had to be about someone the opposite sex of the author, and it had to be about someone elderly. This is mine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door opened, but it did not creak. It &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; creaked. Like Janice’s bones in the morning, it creaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She frowned at the back of the door facing her. Someone stood there, it seemed; a shadow darkened the floor by the doorway. Her eyes were rheumy enough, and the room layout ridicuous enough, that she couldn’t say more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who is it? she called out. Croaked out, more like, but that was the price of eighty years’ of cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Time.» Helpful response, that was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s that?” She was still croaking. She coughed, tried to clear her throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Time,» he said again. She thought it was a he, but his voice sounded funny. Far away. Then again, her ears had been going for long enough now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time? Kids aren’t coming today, so you can have all you want. But who are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«It. is. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow looked darker. She frowned, pursed her lips, and shook her head. “Young man—you are young, aren’t you? You don’t sound old—come in here and sit down and explain yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«I. sit. for. no. one.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice blinked a few times. She sat back in her chair. She tried to take a deep breath, coughed, coughed some more, gave up on the deep breath, contented herself with a swallow instead. That seemed more appropriate anyway. But no, she was just being absurd. Old, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, all right, then, but come in where I can see you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«No. it. is. your. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She swallowed again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time for what?” Just to be sure. The shadow was still getting darker. It could have been her eyes, but the rest of the room was the same as before: fuzzed out to an irritating degree, but bright enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Time. to. depart.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Son, or whatever you are” (she no longer thought it was anyone who ought to be called son, or daughter for that matter) “be clear. I don’t have time for whatever your game is. Had enough of foolishness twenty years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«It. is. time. for. you. to. depart. this. life.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, then. One thing to have a half-cocked notion of a thing like that, but another hear it from the mouth of… time? itself. “Is it now?” she managed. “Well, you took long enough getting here. Family’s been telling me that for a good twenty years now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the shadow stood on the floor in front of the door was all dark now. Shaped something like a man, for all her blurred sight could make out, but black as a night when all the moons were down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was ready, though. Ready as you could be. “Do you announce yourself to &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; like this, or just half-blind old ladies?” She sounded like a bullfrog with a sore throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow answered. «All. those. who. have. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helpful. Not that it mattered. She &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; ready. She was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow was suddenly before her. A starless, moonless night. Time indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice stood up. Face it on your feet, she’d always said. To the blazes with that, now, she concluded. Face it asleep in the night was a better plan. But here she was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She could still run. Jump a little even. So she did. She threw herself at the shadow, and as she came to it, she thought she saw stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then everything was gone except the stars, whirling before suddenly clear eyes. Ten billion galaxies whirled; pulsars flamed and danced in time; suns flared and planets spun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green grass, dusted with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«You. have. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked up. Stars, not night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Spend. it. well.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stood.&lt;/p&gt;

Long days, and many weary of them,&lt;br /&gt;

I need to start using constraining forms (and especially historical forms) once more: that makes for richer, better poetry from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is significant: we learn how to do certain kinds of creative work (perhaps all creative work!) by closely following the forms and approaches of those who preceded us. This is just as true of composing music as of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aside: the fact that the final words of the first and third, and second and fourth stanzas of that poem are the is a total coincidence. There is a greater degree of serendipity in art—or at least, in my art—than would boost my ego to let on. But ego-boosting be damned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These words will not suffice—&lt;br /&gt;
no poetry alone will change produce—&lt;br /&gt;
yet as a reminder and a warning,&lt;br /&gt;
rhythm and letters on a page will do,&lt;br /&gt;
and I will strive:&lt;br /&gt;
    to savor and to taste,&lt;br /&gt;
    to revel and to dance,&lt;br /&gt;

The review proper concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Echoes of Eden says all the right things. Barrs has provided a healthy, sound theology of the arts, reiterating and synthesizing the helpful work of Schaeffer, Lewis, Tolkien, O’Connor, and Dostoevsky. What is more, his survey of English literature grounds that theology in concrete examples we can follow. This is a solid book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a bit more to say about this, because…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one thing it lacked, though: beauty of its own. As Barrs himself says, “A book that is not well-written, no matter how compelling the story is, will not be reread multiple times” (114). I doubt I will read Echoes of Eden again, because this is true for non-fiction as well. Form matters. It may not be quite true that the way we say things is just as important as what we say—better to say the truth boringly than a lie splendidly—but it comes a close second. The truth is beautiful, and we should always aim to present it beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you’ll find the rest interesting! &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/speak-truth-beauty-review-echoes-eden/"&gt;Take a look.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note: I actually meant to have this reviewed about 18 months ago. I got buried in Greek III and it totally slipped my mind! Gladly, the folks at Crossway who sent me the book were understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

That is always an unpleasant experience, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one upside to this whole affair? I took away two important lessons: The first was a reminder to read others generously, even when frustrated with them—a point I spelled out a bit in my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/dont-be-rude.html#edit-and-addendum"&gt;edit-and-addendum&lt;/a&gt; to the original post. The other about the effect of certain rhetorical structures in my writing. The &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; I had here was good (even if I may have misread the trigger for writing the post in the first place), but it was badly executed, and there were &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; reasons for that, having to do with the weight and balance in the original piece. What follows is just me self-critiquing in public: learning about the process of writing “out loud”, as it were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the example I am critiquing is specifically a blog post, a lot of the principles here apply equally to other media, including forms as varied as long-form essays, preaching, lecturing, and even writing fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="my-goals" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My Goals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meant the story I offered as an illustrative example of a broader point. To wit, I had had a bad customer experience with a given company, and it left a bad taste in my mouth that pushed me away from using that company’s software in the future. The story was meant to illustrate that even a single bad experience with a company can emotionally outweight a lot of positive experience with the company, and that emotions tend to fade slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="my-approach" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My Approach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approached the piece with a fairly typical rhetorical structure for this kind of thing: introduce a thesis or idea, detour through a specific example to illustrate it, then come back and drive the main point home. This was a good idea, but the execution failed, and it failed for fairly obvious reasons on reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-problems" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Problems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem was the distribution of the content. The original piece was right around a thousand words long. Of those, some six hundred words were devoted to specific details of my interaction with the company in question. Another hundred words had to do with my follow-up decisions about the products involved. In the whole piece, then, I spent over two thirds of my time talking about the specific example, and only about a third making the actual point I wanted to make. This weighted the content so that the focus was on the details of the story, rather than the bigger picture issue that I walked away with a bad taste in my mouth from my interactions with the company’s customer service representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the story itself was &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; too specific for my aims. I put in quotes from our email exchange, which entirely distracted from the point I wanted to make. It led readers to see whether they also perceived the emails as I had. While this was helpful for leading me to reevaluate the content of the emails, it also completely undercut the point of the post—a point, I should note, whose validity is entirely independent of the details of the incident I used to illustrate it. When I am illustrating a point, I need to let the illustration do the work of &lt;em&gt;illustrating&lt;/em&gt;, without letting the details of the illustration come to the fore in this way. That means eliding all details but those actually essential to make the point. The story isn’t the point, nor are its details. It is there to serve the end of the thesis, and nothing more. The minute it does more than that, it needs to get out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="lesson-learned" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lesson learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those two issues combined to shift the rhetorical effect from what I intended—a general discussion of the need to make sure you treat customers with respect—to something else entirely. Instead of making my point, the example distracted from it. I hope in the future to learn from this by doing two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeping the emphasis on arguing for the thesis, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on an illustration present only to personalize the thesis, especially by keeping the length of the illustration down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeping the details of any illustration used to the minimum essential to make the point at hand (whether illustrating the whole argument or just one part of it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
