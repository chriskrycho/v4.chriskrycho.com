Sin is described in various ways in the Old and New Testaments, and these various
descriptions and names tell us much about how the authors of the Bible
conceived of the power than enslaves us apart from Christ.

The Old Testament has several terms its authors often use to describe the broad
concept of sin:[^1]

[^1]: List drawn from Stanley Grenz, _Theology for the Community of God_.

- *&lsquo;avah*, meaning "bent" or "crooked"
- *&lsquo;aval*, which includes the idea of a lack of integrity, so is often
  given as "iniquity"
- *&lsquo;avar*, meaning "to cross over" or "transgress"
- *ra&lsquo;*, meaning "the rule of evil"
- *ma&lsquo;al*, meaning "breach of trust"
- *pasha&lsquo;*, meaning "to revolt" or "refuse subjection to a rightful
  authority"

From these we see that humanity's brokenness before God in the Old Testament was
often conceived of in terms of doing things the wrong way, or in rejection of
the rightful authority, or a mix of the two. Rebellion against the creator and
his created order are essential ingredients of the concept of sin for the Old
Testament authors. To do evil is to be in rebellion against the right way God
established for things to be done, to reject his *shalom* and replace it with
destruction and disharmony.

The most common term for sin in the Old Testament, however, and the one usually
translated into the English "sin" is *chatha*, meaning "to miss the mark".
Sinning was thus not necessarily always a matter of active, willful rejection
of God. It was also simply failing, by dint of corrupted human nature, to do as
God called humanity to do, in any and all spheres of life. Sin was thus a
pervasive and corrupting influence on *all* of human existence, not only on
those who were consciously rebelling against God.

Unsurprisingly, the New Testament picks up on many of these same ideas. Though
the specific terms used have different semantic ranges than those in the Old
Testament, as a group they cover much of the same territory:

- *parabasis*, "the transgression of a boundary"
- *parakoe*, "disobedience to a voice"
- *paraptoma*, "falling where one should have stood upright"
- *agnoema*, "failing to know what one should have known"
- *hettema*, "diminishing what should have been fully rendered"
- *anomia*, failing to observe a law
- *plemmeleia*, "a discord in the harmonies of God's universe"

To the Old Testament range, they add this final notion of discord in the created
order---a concept that was present in the Old Testament, to be sure, in the
notion of lost *shalom*, but which was not so directly expressed. Again, as in
the Old Testament, these emphasize both failure to do and active rejection of
what is right. And, as in the Old Testament, the New Testament authors' concept
of sin is most commonly expressed in a single word meaning "missing the mark":
*hamartia*.

This congruence between the Old and New Testament views of sin emphasizes the
fundamental unity between the various authors' understanding of the issues at
stake. Sin is everything about humanity's failure to follow God's ways and live
in accord with his design for the universe. It encompasses the whole range of
human foibles, from  accidental failure and ignorance to the kind of rebellion
that shakes its fist at the heavens or boldly (and foolishly) proclaims that
there is no God. Sin is getting it wrong---or, to put it another way that
better captures the breadth of Scriptural language on the issue, not getting it
*perfectly* right, for whatever reason.
