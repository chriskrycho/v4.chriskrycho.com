The Washington Times reports:

> North Korea tyrant Kim Jong-un has reportedly ordered that 33 Christians
> believed to be working alongside South Korean Baptist missionary Kim Jung-wook
> be put to death.

N.b. the source is Breitbart, which I usually take with a very large grain of
salt---but this is not exactly surprising for Kim Jong-un or North Korea, so it
is deserving of further investigation and prayer in any case.
