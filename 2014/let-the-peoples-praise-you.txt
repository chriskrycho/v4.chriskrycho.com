Summary: A setting of Psalm 67 for choir, harpsichord, harp, and two guitars ("stringed instruments," as the title suggests). Alas, all digital voices, but I've attached the score as well.

I read Psalm 67 for my [devotions][devotions] today, and was reminded that I had set the
text to music several years ago during my studies in music composition at OU.
Unfortunately, I have never been able to have the piece performed (even with a
piano reduction)---the position of choral director was in transition the
semester I composed it, and I simply never got around to it afterward.
Nonetheless, I think you may enjoy this digital version. You can, however,
[download the score][download] so you can follow the text setting if you like.
