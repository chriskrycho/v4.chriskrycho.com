_Up the ante_, you say? Sure, we'll tackle the small, easy problem of _systemic force and individual agency_ this season on [Winning Slowly].

> [**5.01: A Ph.D.-Level Math Problem**][5.01]---Structures and systems, agency and individuals: three axes (and a sub-axis) for thinking about the world we live in.
>
> We introduce our system for thinking about the “structure/agency” or “systems and individuals” problem: how do the systems and structures of our lives shape us? How do we shape them? How free are we, and where are the places where more freedom is good, and the places where it might actually be bad? How do we confront the structural issues we face, or strengthen and preserve the good systems we do have in place?

[Listen to the whole thing!][5.01] And then [tell us] what you think.
