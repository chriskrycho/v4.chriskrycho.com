        <div class="content">

<p><i class='editorial'>My wife and a few others regularly do a 30-minute writing challenge every Tuesday evening. This week, since I’m taking some time off, I got to participate! The prompt was: <em>Write a story about trees which whisper poems to those who know how to hear them. (It’s not allowed to be scary.)</em></i></p>
<hr />
<p>Her first question was: “Who taught the trees to speak?”</p>
<p>Her second, of course, was: “Any why only in such <em>awful</em> poetry?”</p>
<p>I didn’t always know about the whispers, and of course I didn’t believe old Dallet when he told me about it, and it took me six weeks to hear them for the first time myself—so I didn’t particularly expect Annyth to hear them immediately after I mentioned them to her. I probably should have. She’d always been a little odd. But whatever the reason, she just blinked those round not-quite-brown, not-quite-green eyes at me a few times, like some slightly startled owl caught out in daylight, and then giggled.</p>
<p>For good reason: the spruces had just started in on a ridiculous ditty about nymphs—</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>They dance like dancers</em><br />
<em>and twirl like twirlers</em><br />
<em>and all the little nymphs</em><br />
<em>are sort of like curlers</em><br />
<em>but sans the ice</em><br />
<em>and add a dash of spice…</em></div>
<p>You get the idea. The <em>worst</em> kinds of puns and rhymes, for hours on end. Annyth’s second question had good cause.</p>
<p>Apparently, I’d gotten lost in my own mind again, listening to the rhymes, because she repeated her questions.</p>
<p>“Who taught the trees to speak? Any why only in such <em>awful</em> poetry?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “No one knows who taught them. Maybe they’ve always known.” She somehow managed to furrow her brows <em>and</em> quirk them at me at the same time. “Okay, probably not, but Dallet said his grandfather taught him, and that <em>his</em> great-uncle taught him, and so on back a thousand years, and either the first one forgot to tell anyone that he was the one responsible for it all, or everyone else—”</p>
<p>“Heard this terrible poetry and decided to make sure his name didn’t live on at all?”</p>
<p>I laughed. "Probably.</p>
<p>The nymph poem had ended; now they were onto something about stream beds…</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>It runs, so cool, down through the bed</em><br />
<em>And even though, the stream, it has no head</em><br />
<em>It likes to lie down in its bed</em><br />
<em>Until it comes to make us fed…</em></div>
<p>She turned away from the trees for a moment and looked at me. “Is it… <em>always</em> this bad?”</p>
<p>I shrugged again. “Not… <em>always</em>.”</p>
<p>Now her eyebrows were <em>raised</em> and quirked.</p>
<p>“I mean, sometimes it’s actually worse. When they start telling limericks… just stop up your ears. But every once in a while some tree or another will start up a sonnet and you’ll get those fourteen lines of decency.”</p>
<p>She smirked. “A sonnet? Tree love poems?”</p>
<p>I shrugged again. I seemed to be doing a lot of that today. “As far as tree love poems go, honestly, the sonnets are preferable. Sappy but not… weird.”</p>
<p>Now the eyebrows went completely flat. “I don’t think I want to know.”</p>
<p>“You don’t, but you probably will, soon enough. Now that you’ve heard them, you’ll never be able to <em>unhear</em> them.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” The eyebrows were climbing again. “Don’t they stop?”</p>
<p>I smiled my <em>worried</em> smile at her. “What, exactly, do you think you’re hearing?”</p>
<p>The eyebrows furrowed for a moment again as she listened, then twitched and quivered a moment in what looked like consternation, then rose until I thought they would come entirely off the top of her head. “No. No no no no no.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. Again. <em>Stop shrugging, idiot.</em></p>
<p>“It’s the <em>wind</em>?”</p>
<p>I nodded, smiled my <em>sympathetic, just-one-side-of-my-mouth quirked</em> smile at her. “And when was the last time you heard a day without a breeze?”</p>
<p>Annyth shook her head. Her eyebrows were darting furiously this way and that. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such versatile eyebrows, truly. She started breathing a little faster. Her eyes were darting to match her eyebrows. “You mean to tell me that you thought it would be <em>nice</em> to subject me to these awful, awful rhymes for the <em>rest of my life</em>?”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“That’s what you said, you…” she paused, listened for a moment:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>like a jolly little man with no brain</em><br />
<em>he dances across the plain</em><br />
<em>and does a dance, a sprightly jig</em><br />
<em>as if he were a baboon grown over big</em></div>
<p>“You little man with no brain, you baboon grown over big!” The eyebrows were low and fierce.</p>
<p>I… shrugged. <em>Again.</em> What was it with the shrugs today?</p>
<p>Annyth paused. “They weren’t <em>actually</em> singing that about you, were they?” Now the eyebrows were in thinking posture: left furrowed more than right, right slightly quirked.</p>
<p>I tried desperately to keep my shoulders from moving. No more shrugs. “I… honestly don’t know. I’ve never really paid attention to why the songs change.”</p>
<p>Annyth stared at me like I were a complete dunce.</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>He does not see, he has no eyes</em><br />
<em>Though stare out from his face they do</em><br />
<em>He listens to winds and hears but lies</em><br />
<em>Though every day he hears the truth</em></div>
<p><em>My</em> eyes went wide. <em>Her</em> eyes went wide. We looked at the trees. I swallowed. “That was… just a coincidence, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>The wind stopped.</p>
<p>I shivered, looked at her. Her hazel owl eyes stared back wide.</p>
<p>And then it whispered in the spruce trees.</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>Ask</em></div>
<p>We breathed. “Ask what?” Annyth whispered back.</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>Ask, ask, ask</em><br />
  <em>Ten thousand years</em></div>
<p>Call and response: the oaks were answering the spruce trees with a low flutter to the whisper in the needles.</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>Ask, ask, ask</em><br />
  <em>Just one question</em><br />
<em>Ask, ask, ask</em><br />
  <em>Ignored, unheard</em><br />
<em>Ask, ask, ask</em><br />
  <em>Why do you have ears</em><br />
<em>Ask, ask, ask</em><br />
  <em>And we speak</em><br />
<em>Ask, ask, ask</em><br />
  <em>And you listen not</em><br />
<em>Ask, ask, ask</em><br />
  <em>Ask, ask, ask</em><br />
<em>Ask, ask, ask</em><br />
  <em>Ask, ask, ask</em></div>
<p>Silence, again.</p>
<p>I looked at Annyth, ran my tongue across my bottom teeth, shrugged (of course), and mouthed, “Ask?”</p>
<p>She giggled. The sound startled in the silence, but still the trees stood waiting.</p>
<p>I cleared my throat. “Ask what?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes at me. “Who taught you to speak?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Then, like a whispered shout in the gathering dusk, spruce and oak in chorus:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>God</em></div>
<p>That was new.</p>
<p>She smiled at me. “When?”</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>At dawn</em><br />
  <em>At beginning times</em><br />
    <em>At start of age</em><br />
       <em>At end of unseeing</em></div>
<p>Eyebrows wide, Annyth asked: “Why?”</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>Ask, ask, ask</em></div>
<p>Annyth’s eyes were bright with joy, and round; her eyebrows high again. I shrugged uncomprehending. “Don’t you hear?” she said. “We just keep asking. That’s what we do. Until we find the truth. We keep asking.”</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>Ask, ask, ask</em></div>
<p>The poetry ran on. But no more folly. Now it had <em>answers.</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>
